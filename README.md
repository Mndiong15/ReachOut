## Privacy Policy for ReachOut

**Last Updated:** 11/11/2024

ReachOut is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our app. By using ReachOut, you agree to the terms outlined below.

### 1. Data Collection
ReachOut does not collect, store, or share any personal data on servers. All data, including contact information, reminders, and communication logs, is stored locally on your device. This means that your information remains private and inaccessible to anyone else, including the developer.

### 2. Permissions Requested
To provide its functionality, ReachOut requests access to the following permissions:
- **Contacts:** This permission allows you to import contacts into the app for easier reminder setup. ReachOut does not upload or share your contact information with any external services.
- **Phone and SMS:** ReachOut allows you to call or text contacts directly from the app. This access is limited to enabling direct communication from within the app and does not record or transmit call or message data.

### 3. No Data Sharing
Since ReachOut does not collect or store your data on servers, no data is ever shared with third parties. All data is kept on your device, and ReachOut has no access to your information.

### 4. Security
As all data is stored locally on your device, it is protected by your deviceâ€™s security settings. ReachOut recommends that you use device security measures, such as passwords or biometric authentication, to safeguard your data.

### 5. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app, and your continued use of ReachOut after any updates means you accept the revised policy.
